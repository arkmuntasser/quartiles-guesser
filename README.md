# quartiles-guesser
 Generates a list of potentially valid words for use in the Apple News+ game, Quartiles.

 I hyperfixated on the May 26th puzzle because I was 1 word away from getting all the words and I had never been that close before. I couldn't sleep because of it. And when I did sleep I dreamt about what the answers could be. So finally I wrote this to help me generate possible words that could work.

 No, I don't consider it cheating because I put in a decent amount of effort in to making this thing. I earned that perfect score.

 I don't intend to use this again, but I release it into the world for anyone else that might suffer due to this game.
